This is a bot that checks every hour for files that have been uploaded between 2-4 days ago and deletes them (with some requirements).

Originally this started as just a thing for CC, I am now open sourcing this so that other wikis may use it too if they wish, tho keep in mind that this was designed for CC's use-case, and may need modification before being used else where (such as the deletion summary - please do change that if you fork it).
